**Power Types**
- Added new `render_player_outer_layer` field to `apugli:entity_texture_overlay` power type.

**Entity Action Types**
- Added new `bientity_action` field to `apugli:fire_projectile`. This acts with the entity that used the action as the actor and the projectile as the target.

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed `apugli:keys_pressed` breaking upon reloading the player (such as entering a new dimension).
