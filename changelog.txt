## Apugli v1.7.0 (Fabric/Quilt 1.19)
**Power Types**
- Added `apugli:action_on_tame_hit`, `apugli:action_when_tame_hit`, `apugli:instant_effect_immunity` power types.
- Adjusted `apugli:rocket_jump` sound to be higher pitched and lower in volume.
- `apugli:rocket_jump` no longer hurts non living entities and armor stands.
- `apugli:rocket_jump` deals less knockback to entities that aren't the user.
- Added `water_modifier` and `water_modifiers` fields to `apugli:rocket_jump`, the rocket jump `speed`/velocity will now be modified with this modifier when the entity is touching water.
- Removed `apugli:effect_whitelist`, use Apoli's inverted field for `apoli:effect_immunity`.

**Item Actions**
- `apugli:action_on_durability_change` is now compatible with `apoli:damage`.
- Both damage actions now utilise increase action from `apugli:action_on_durability_change` if they increase the durability of an item.

**Bugfixes**
- Made a temporary incompatibility fix involving Collective and `apugli:edible_item`.
- Modified `apugli:edible_item` logic to make eating an item not increment relevant scores twice.
- Fixed `apugli:modify_enchant_level` not reapplying after first application.

**Misc**
- Updated to MC 1.19,
- Updated modifier format to new Apoli format for powers/actions that contained modifier fields
