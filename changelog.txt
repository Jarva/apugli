## Apugli v1.7.0 (Fabric 1.19)
**Power Types**
- Added `apugli:action_on_tame_hit`, `apugli:action_when_tame_hit`, `apugli:instant_effect_immunity` power types.
- Adjusted `apugli:rocket_jump` sound to be higher pitched and lower in volume.
- `apugli:rocket_jump` no longer hurts non-living entities and armor stands.
- `apugli:rocket_jump` deals less knockback to entities that aren't the user.
- Changed `apugli:rocket_jump` field names around, `speed` is now `velocity`.
- Added `velocity_clamp` field to `apugli:rocket_jump`, which will clamp the rocket jump's added velocity to the value if it goes higher than this or lower than negative this. This defaults to velocity * 1.8.
- Added `water_modifier` and `water_modifiers` fields to `apugli:rocket_jump`, the rocket jump velocity will now be modified with this modifier when the entity is touching water.
- Added `damage_modifier` and `damage_modifiers` fields to `apugli:rocket_jump`, this modifies the damage dealt from the explosion caused by the power
- Removed `apugli:effect_whitelist`, use Apoli's `inverted` field within `apoli:effect_immunity`.

**Bi-entity Actions**
- Rewrote `apugli:hits_on_target` to be actually usable.
- `apugli:hits_on_target` now resets when an entity hasn't been hit for default 100 ticks/5 seconds, this value is specified in the mod's config.

**Damage Conditions**
- Removed `apugli:explosive`, use `apoli:explosive` instead.

**Item Actions**
- `apugli:action_on_durability_change` is now compatible with `apoli:damage`.
- Both damage actions now utilise increase action from `apugli:action_on_durability_change` if they increase the durability of an item.

**Bugfixes**
- Made a temporary incompatibility fix involving Collective and `apugli:edible_item`.
- Modified `apugli:edible_item` logic to make eating an item not increment relevant scores twice.
- Fixed `apugli:modify_enchant_level` not reapplying after first application.
- Fixed `apugli:structure` entity condition getting an incorrect field.

**Misc**
- Added handshake packet along with a way for dependents to disable Apugli's handshake packet, so they can use their own handshake packets.
- Updated to MC 1.19.
- Updated modifier format to new Apoli format for powers/actions that contained modifier fields.
- Refactored directory location to com.github.merchantpug.apugli to match maven group (previously io.github.merchantpug.apugli).
